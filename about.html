          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Ahmed Azab is a final-year architecture student in the Digital Architecture Program
            at Galala University. His academic work focuses on integrating advanced digital
            tools with architectural design, with particular attention to environmental
            performance and cultural context. As a LEED® Green Associate™, he approaches
            sustainability as a core design principle rather than a technical add-on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alongside architecture, Ahmed is a content creator, amateur photographer, and
            videographer with a strong interest in documenting Egypt’s architectural identity.
            This visual practice informs his architectural thinking by strengthening his
            sensitivity to atmosphere, materiality, and the lived experience of space.
          </p>

          <h2>Design Focus</h2>
          <p>
            Ahmed’s design interests lie in parametric design, digital fabrication, and
            AI-driven workflows as tools for exploring form, performance, and spatial logic.
            He is especially interested in the role of digital methodologies in heritage
            contexts, and how contemporary architecture can engage existing environments in a
            meaningful and responsible way.
          </p>

          <h2>Professional Exposure</h2>
          <p>
            Through internships and collaborative projects, Ahmed has gained experience in
            architectural modeling, visualization, environmental analysis, and sustainability
            documentation. His exposure to professional practice has strengthened his ability
            to navigate different stages of the design process while maintaining conceptual
            clarity and technical rigor.
